My interests include being outdoors, traveling, and video games.
I love everything outdoors but I really enjoy watersports like scuba
and wakeboarding.

## Programming Background
I have limited experince in c, c++, assembler, ruby, html, and css.  I 
have also played around with a raspberry pi.  During CS 165 I really liked
programming the game of life.
